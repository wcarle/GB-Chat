# GB-Chat
Simple reverse engineer of GiantBomb Chat.
Basic functionality is up and running.  Right now it's very basic and rough.  
The next steps will be to add redis to support multiple chat nodes.

Technology used:
PHP
NGINX
Socket.IO
Akamai
Redis

Client Side:
Handlebars
jquery.js
jquery-ui.js
swfobject.js
modernizer.js

Here is my best guess at the current GiantBomb chat architecture:
